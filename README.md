## Installation

Install the package with pip:

```bash
pip install telepay
```

Or using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```bash
poetry add telepay
```

## Using the library

Refer to the [TelePay Docs](https://telepay.readme.io) and follow the [first steps guide](https://telepay.readme.io/reference/first-steps), you'll get your TelePay account and API key.

To make requests to the TelePay API, you need to import a client. We have two clients:
* `TelePaySyncClient`: make requests synchronously.
* `TelePayAsyncClient` make requests asynchronously.

**Import and use the client**

```python
from telepay.v1 import TelePaySyncClient, TelePayAsyncClient

client = TelePaySyncClient(secret_api_key)
client = TelePayAsyncClient(secret_api_key)
```

**Use the client as a context manager**

We recommend using the client as a context manager, like this:

```python
with TelePaySyncClient(secret_api_key) as client:
    # use the client
    ...
```

or

```python
async with TelePayAsyncClient(secret_api_key) as client:
    # use the client
    ...
```

## API endpoints

The API endpoints are documented in the [TelePay documentation](https://telepay.readme.io/reference/endpoints), refer to that pages to know more about them.

To manage the requests, if the client is async, you should use the `await` keyword, like this:

```python
response = await client.method(...)
```

Where `method` is the endpoint method.

**get_me**

## Webhooks

> Webhooks allows you to get updates delivered to your app server whenever we have events on our side. We will send a POST request over HTTPS, with serialized JSON data of the event, to the endpoint defined by you in the Developers > Webhooks section, in your merchant dashboard. [Read more in the docs](https://telepay.readme.io/reference/webhooks).


The `telepay.v1.webhooks` module contains utilities to manage webhooks received on your side.

* `get_signature(data, secret)`: Returns a webhook signature, used to verify data integrity of the webhook. This is optional, but highly recommended.
* `TelePayWebhookListener`: A lightweight webhook listener, to receive webhooks from TelePay. You could build your own, like using django views, flask views, or any other web framework. Your choice.

**Example using `TelePayWebhookListener`**

```python
from telepay.v1.webhooks import TelePayWebhookListener


def callback(headers, data):
    print("Executing callback...")
    # do your stuff here


listener = TelePayWebhookListener(
    secret="SECRET",
    callback=callback,
    host="localhost",
    port=5000,
    url="/webhook",
    log_level="error",
)

listener.listen()
```

Running the listener will output something like this:

![Webhook listener](https://github.com/TelePay-cash/telepay-python/blob/main/docs/webhook-listener.png?raw=true)

Modify the listener parameters to your needs, knowing this:
* `secret`: A secret token that your side knows and it's configured in the webhook definition, on the TelePay dashboard.
* `callback`: The callback function that is called when new webhook arrives, receiving it's HTTP headers and data.
* `host`: The host on which the listener will be running.
* `port`: The port on which the listener will be exposed.
* `url`: The webhook url, which is secret and should only be known by your app and TelePay. Otherwise, it could lead to security issues.
* `log_level`: The listener logger level, like `"error"`, `"info"` or `"debug"`.
